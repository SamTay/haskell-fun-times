# Monad transformers
Chapter [25](../25_Composing-Types) demonstrated the need for monad transformers
and what they accomplish.
This chapter is a deeper dive to get more comfortable with them in practice.

### 26.2 MaybeT
Just as the Maybe monad is extremely useful,
its transformer variant MaybeT is an important transformer.
```haskell
newtype MaybeT m a =
  MaybeT { runMaybeT :: m (Maybe a) }
```
Notice the similarity in the structures of the MaybeT and Compose types;
that structure leads to reusing the same pattern for functor & applicative instances:
```haskell
instance (Functor m) => Functor (MaybeT m) where
  fmap f (MaybeT ma) =
    MaybeT $ (fmap . fmap) f ma

instance (Applicative m) => Applicative (MaybeT m) where
  pure x = MaybeT . pure . pure
  (MaybeT mMab) <*> (MaybeT mMa) =
    MaybeT $ liftA2 (<*>) mMab mMa
    -- or
    MaybeT $ (<*>) <$> mMab <*> mMa
```
Again, we only need to do something different once we get to the monad instances,
since functors & applicatives are closed under composition in general.

#### MaybeT Monad instance
Nothing too surprising here:
```haskell
instance (Monad m) => Monad (MaybeT m) where
  return = pure

  (>>=) :: MaybeT m a
        -> (a -> MaybeT m b)
        -> MaybeT m b
  (MaybeT mMa) >>= aMmb =
    MaybeT $ do
      -- v :: Maybe a
      v <- mMa
      case v of
        Nothing -> return Nothing
        Just y  -> runMaybeT $ aMmb y
```

### 26.3 EitherT
This is the newtype for the Either transformer:
```haskell
newtype EitherT e m a =
  EitherT { runEitherT :: m (EitherT e a) }
```

#### Exercises: EitherT
1. Write the Functor instance for EitherT.

  ```haskell
  instance (Functor f) =>
    Functor (EitherT e f) where
      fmap f (EitherT ma) = EitherT $ (fmap . fmap) f ma
  ```

2. Write the Applicative instance for EitherT.

  ```haskell
  instance (Applicative f) =>
    Applicative (EitherT e f) where
      pure = EitherT . pure . pure

      (EitherT mf) <*> (EitherT ma) =
        EitherT $ (<*>) <$> mf <*> ma
  ```

3. Write the Monad instance for EitherT.

  ```haskell
  instance (Monad m) =>
    Monad (EitherT e m) where
      return = pure

      (EitherT ma) >>= f = EitherT $ do
        -- a :: Either e a
        a <- ma
        case a of
          Left e  -> return $ Left e
          Right x -> runEitherT $ f x
  ```

4. Write the `swapEitherT` helper function for EitherT.

  ```haskell
  swapEitherT :: (Functor m) => EitherT e m a -> EitherT a m e
  swapEitherT (EitherT ma) = EitherT $ swapEither <$> ma
  ```

5. Write the transformer variant of the `either` catamorphism.

  ```haskell
  eitherT :: Monad m => (a -> m c) -> (b -> m c) -> EitherT a m b -> m c
  eitherT f g (EitherT ma) = ma >>= either f g
  ```

### 26.4 ReaderT
ReaderT is one of the most common transformers in conventional Haskell.
It's just like Reader, but generating additional structure in the return type:
```haskell
newtype ReaderT r m a =
  ReaderT { runReaderT :: r -> m a }
```
I decided to write the instances myself,
and they look a bit different than the book's,
but they type check just fine:
```haskell
instance (Functor m) =>
  Functor (ReaderT r m) where
    fmap f (ReaderT rma) = ReaderT $ fmap f . rma

instance (Applicative f) =>
  Applicative (ReaderT e f) where
    pure x = ReaderT $ const (pure x)

    (<*>) :: ReaderT r f (a -> b)
          -> ReaderT r f a
          -> ReaderT r f b
    (ReaderT mf) <*> (ReaderT ma) =
      ReaderT $ \r -> (mf r) <*> (ma r)

instance (Monad m) => Monad (ReaderT r m) where
  return = pure

  (>>=) :: ReaderT r m a
        -> (a -> ReaderT r m b)
        -> ReaderT r m b
  (ReaderT ma) >>= f =
    ReaderT $ \r -> do
    a <- ma r
    runReaderT (f a) r
```

### 26.5 StateT
StateT is State with additional monadic structure around the function result, just like Reader and ReaderT.
```haskell
newtype StateT s m a =
  StateT { runStateT :: s -> m (a, s) }
```

#### Exercises: StateT
We're implementing the strict variant (as opposed to lazy), which is the "obvious" implementation:
```haskell
instance (Functor m) =>
  Functor (StateT s m) where
    fmap f (StateT smf) = StateT $ \s ->
      fmap (\(x, s1) -> (f x, s1)) (smf s)

instance (Monad m) =>
  Applicative (StateT s m) where
    pure x = StateT $ \s -> pure (x, s)

    (<*>) :: StateT s m (a -> b)
          -> StateT s m a
          -> StateT s m b
    (StateT smf) <*> (StateT sma) = StateT $ \s1 -> do
      (ab, s2) <- smf s1
      (a, s3)  <- sma s2
      return (ab a, s3)

instance (Monad m) => Monad (StateT s m) where
  return = pure

  (>>=) :: StateT s m a
        -> (a -> StateT s m b)
        -> StateT s m b
  (StateT sma) >>= f = StateT $ \s1 -> do
    (a, s2) <- sma s1
    (runStateT (f a)) s2
```
Notice we need a monadic constraint for the applicative instance;
this is needed to feed the successive states through each computation,
as opposed to just feeding the initial state through each computation.

### 26.6 Types you probably don't want to use
Not every type will necessarily be performant or make sense, such as ListT and Writer/WriterT.

#### Why not use Writer or WriterT?
First of all, State can do what Writer can do plus more.
In addition, it is commonly too lazy or too strict for a given problem,
which results in too much memory usage.
Writer can accumulate unevaluated thunks, causing memory leaks.
For example, it is inappropriate for logging in long-running processes,
since the logged values can't be retrieved until the computation is complete.

#### The ListT you want isn't made from the List type
The obvious implementation of ListT is generally not recommended because:
1. The obvious obvious attempt isn't associative.
2. It's not very fast.
3. Streaming libraries like [pipes](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) and [conduit](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit) do it better for most cases.

Lists in Haskell are as much a control structure as they are a data structure,
so streaming libraries generally suffice when we need transformers.

### 26.7 Recovering an ordinary type from a transformer
We can use the `Identity` type to recover non-transformer versions of transformer variants:
```haskell
type MyIdentity a = IdentityT Identity a
type Maybe a      = MaybeT Identity a
type Either e a   = EitherT e Identity a
type Reader r a   = ReaderT e Identity a
type State s a    = StateT s Identity a
```
We don't ordinarily need to do this for transformers that already have corresponding non-transformer types.
However, `ReaderT` is part of the Scotty environment and you can't easily retrieve the `Reader` type out of it
because `Reader` is not a type that exists on its own.
Thus, it may present a situation where we only need `Reader`, not `ReaderT`,
and `ReaderT Identity` can act as a `Reader` compatible with Scotty.

#### The transformers library
In general, we don't need to make these transformer types ourselves -
many of them are in base or the `transformers` library.

#### A note on ExceptT
Note that the `either` library on Hackage provides an `EitherT` type,
however most Haskellers are moving to the identical `ExceptT` type in the `transformers` library.
This is mainly because `transformers` comes packaged with GHC already.

### 26.8 Lexically inner is structurally outer
One tricky part about monad transformers:
the **lexical representation** of the types are *counterintuitive*
with respect to the **structure of their values**.
Consider the definitions of these transfomer types:
```haskell
newtype ExceptT e m a =
  ExceptT { runExceptT :: m (Either e a)) }
newtype MaybeT m a =
  MaybeT { runMaybeT :: m (Maybe a) }
newtype ReaderT r m a =
  ReaderT { runReaderT :: r -> m a }
```
Note that the additional structure `m` is always wrapped *around* the value.
It's only wrapped around things we can **have**, not things we **need**,
as can be seen in `ReaderT`.
Consequentially, a series of monad transformers will begin with the innermost type:
```haskell
import Control.Monad.Trans.Except
import Control.Monad.Trans.Maybe
import Control.Monad.Trans.Reader

-- We only need to use return once because it's one big Monad
embedded :: MaybeT (ExceptT String (ReaderT () IO)) Int
embedded = return 1

unwrap :: () -> IO (Either String (Maybe Int))
unwrap = (runReaderT . runExceptT . runMaybeT) embedded

Î»> unwrap ()
Right (Just 1)
```
See how the structure of the values (`Right (Just x))`) is the reverse of the type compositions
(`MaybeT (ExceptT x y)`).
When we say **base monad** we mean the structurally outermost monad.
In the example above the base monad of `embedded` is Reader,
and the base monad of `unwrap ()` is Either.

### 26.9 MonadTrans
We often want to lift functions into a larger context:
```haskell
fmap :: Functor f =>      (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
liftA :: Applicative f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
liftM :: Monad m =>       (a -> r) -> m a -> m r
```
but sometimes we need to lift over more structure than these types permit,
such as the innermost position in a stack of monad transformers.

#### The typeclass that lifts
MonadTrans is a typeclass with one core method: `lift`.
It is for lifting actions in some Monad over a transformer type
which wraps itself in the original monad.
```haskell
class MonadTrans t where
  lift :: (Monad m) => m a -> t m a
```
Let's motivate this with a simple example:

#### Motivating MonadTrans
Scotty has monad transformers that are themselves newtypes for monad transformer stacks:
```haskell
newtype ScottyT e m a =
  ScottyT { runS :: State (ScottyState e m) a }
  deriving ( Functor, Applicative, Monad )
newtype ActionT e m a =
  ActionT { runAM :: ExceptT (ActionError e)
                             (ReaderT ActionEnv
                             (StateT ScottyResponse m)) a }
  deriving ( Functor, Applicative )
type ScottyM = ScottyT Text IO
type ActionM = ActionT Text IO
```

And this is a hello world example **with a type error**:
```haskell
main = scotty 3000 $ do
  get "/:word" $ do
    beam <- param "word"
    -- we cant use IO willy nilly here
    putStrLn "hello"
    html $ mconcat ["<h1>Scotty, ", beam, " me up!</h1>"]
```
We can't use `putStrLn :: IO ()` because the `do` block has type `ActionM ()`.
Instead, we can lift:
```haskell
import Control.Monad.Trans.Class
lift $ putStrLn "hello"
```
Note that `lift` is leveraging the `MonadTrans` instance of `ActionT e`,
hence `lift :: (MonadTrans t) => IO a -> t IO a` specializes to
`lift :: IO a -> ActionM a`.
Running `main` in GHCi and navigating to `http://localhost:3000/beam`
results in both "Scotty, beam me up!" in the browser and "hello" in the terminal.

Since `ActionT` is itself defined in terms of three more monad transformers,
it can simply wrap around composed `lift`s:
```haskell
instance MonadTrans (ActionT e) where
  lift = ActionT . lift . lift . lift
```

Now, if we take all of the individual implementations of those `lift` functions,
we can see the benefit of this typeclass and how much terseness we gain:
```haskell
main = scotty 3000 $ do
  get "/:word" $ do
    beam <- param "word"
      (ActionT
      . (ExceptT . fmap Right)
      . ReaderT . const
      . \m -> StateT (\s -> do
                         a <- m
                         return (a, s))
      ) (putStrLn "hello")
    html $ mconcat ["<h1>Scotty, ", beam, " me up!</h1>"]
```

To summarize, lifting is embedding an expression within a larger context
by adding structure that doesn't do anything.
