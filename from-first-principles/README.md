# Haskell Programming From First Principles

This directory contains notes & exercises from [Haskell Programming From First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/). Thanks [@bitemyapp](https://github.com/bitemyapp)!

I don't expect many people to end up here, but if you do, I would recommend not reading my solutions and figuring out the exercises on your own. The subreddit [r/HaskellBook](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaskellBook/) is also a great place to ask questions and get feedback/advice on the material and specific exercises.
